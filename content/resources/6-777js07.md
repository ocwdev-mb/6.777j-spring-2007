description: An illustration of the prototype design of a microsystem cooler that
  is being fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The microsystem cooler is
  suited mostly to volume-limited applications that require cooling below the ambient
  or sink temperature. (Image courtesy of NASA Glenn Research Center.)
